# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

##### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a client who was looking to create a new version of their current game, Draw It or Lose It. They wanted to create a web-based game in which two teams would take turns guessing a word or phrase based on an image which slowly became more complete over the span of the round's timer. 

##### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that I was able to thoughtfully consider the needs of the client and explain the design constraints which occured as a result. 
In determining the best course of action for this project I was careful to consider things such as hardware requirements, expertise, and the budget required for a project of this size. 

##### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I thought that the most helpful part of this document was the domain Model. Having to explain the process and flow of the UML diagram help me to better understand how the pieces of the puzzle went together when it came time to develop the code. 

##### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had to pick just one of the sections of this document to revise, it would be the Evaluation section. I would chose this section because I feel that I could have been for specific in my evaluation of each operating platform as it relates to the client.

##### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user needs to be able to have a seamless flow of the game and not run into issues on waiting for the next step to load. I implemented this need into my design by keeping in mind the time and resources it takes for each item to be sent to the client device and making sure that memory management was crucial in the design process. It's important to keep in mind the user's needs because the user is going to be the one who determines how useful your software is. If the user doesn't like how a certain function works then they'll find a different software which suits them better. 

##### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the designing of this software by looking at what the client was requesting but also taking into consideration the building blocks behind the specifications that the client gave me. In designing a similar software application, I would focus on discussing with the client more specifics about the outcome they are looking for and what limitations they themselves have in relation to the project. Otherwise I would follow a similar path of starting by analyzing the requests from the client and determining what else is required to give them that desired outcome.
